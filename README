**Version 1.2.1 released!**

GMAP version of 2015-07-23 is not compatible with TAPIS as a bug in their software does not provide strand information for all alignments.  We recommend using a more recent version.  Thank you to Lianfeng Gu from Haixia Institute of Science and Technology (HIST) for bringing this to our attention!

# Summay

TAPIS (Transriptome Analysis Pipeline from Isoform Sequencing)
is a program for correcting and aligning long reads with/without
second generation reads, transcript clustering, novel and full-length
splice isoform detection, and identification and analysis of
polyadenylation (poly(A)) and alternative poly(A) (APA).

# Install

```
python setup.py build
